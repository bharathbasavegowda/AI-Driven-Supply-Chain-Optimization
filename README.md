# Smarter, Greener Hospitals: AI in Supply Chain & Inventory Management 🏥♻️

## Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Supply Chain Operations** within the healthcare sector. As an MS Business Analytics student, I analyzed how AI-driven predictive modeling can transform hospital warehouses into high-efficiency, sustainable hubs.

## Key Strategic Results
Based on my research and analysis of industry leaders like Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic:
* **Cost Efficiency:** Potential for up to **$16M in annual savings** through optimized restocking.
* **Waste Reduction:** AI forecasting can lead to **20% less medical waste** by preventing product expiration.
* **Reliability:** Cleveland Clinic achieved a **99% supply availability** rate using predictive AI.

## The Strategy Framework
I developed a four-stage roadmap for AI integration in healthcare logistics:
1. **Track:** Utilizing RFID tags for real-time data collection.
2. **Predict:** Forecasting demand to prevent critical shortages.
3. **Optimize:** Auto-adjusting orders to reduce inventory overhead.
4. **Monitor:** Real-time dashboards for stock levels and expiry dates.
